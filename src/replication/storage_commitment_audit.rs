//! Gossip-triggered contiguous-subtree storage audit (ADR-0002).
//!
//! A node commits to what it stores (a signed Merkle [`StorageCommitment`]
//! gossiped to neighbours). On receiving a peer's changed commitment, a
//! neighbour may audit it: pin the just-gossiped root, send a fresh nonce that
//! deterministically selects one contiguous subtree, and require the peer to
//! prove that subtree (structure + real bytes) within a deadline. This module
//! owns the auditor entry point [`run_subtree_audit`] and the responder handler
//! [`handle_subtree_challenge`]; the pure proof maths live in
//! [`crate::replication::subtree`].
