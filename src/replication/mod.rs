//! Replication subsystem for the Autonomi network.
//!
//! Implements Kademlia-style replication with:
//! - Fresh replication with `PoP` verification
//! - Neighbor sync with round-robin cycle management
//! - Batched quorum verification
//! - Storage audit protocol (anti-outsourcing)
//! - `PaidForList` persistence and convergence
//! - Responsibility pruning with hysteresis

// The replication engine intentionally holds `RwLock` read guards across await
// boundaries (e.g. reading sync_history while calling audit_tick). Clippy's
// nursery lint `significant_drop_tightening` flags these, but the guards must
// remain live for the duration of the call.
